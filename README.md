# python-tic-tac-toe

Python class final project

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to learn and utilize a Python library that was not taught in class. The library that our group decided to pursue was the [tkinter library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

## What does the tkinter libarary do?

The tkinter library is the standard GUI implementation for python programs. Using this library, we decided to create the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
